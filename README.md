## PSU Programmer Project

PSU programming stick which can be used to program PSU boards on PCB boardstacks.

### Interface

The PSU boards on the PCB boardstacks rev6 and earlier use a PDI interface to program the microcontroller. This programming stick uses a raspberry pi zero in order to interface with the PDI interface, and write hexfiles into the memory of the microcontroller. The microcontroller on the PSU boards is an ATxMEGA 16e5, and the pinout is as follows:
